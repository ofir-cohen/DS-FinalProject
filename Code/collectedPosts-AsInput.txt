He was one of the towering figures of the last 100 years—an American hero whose life and leadership truly earned him the title “God’s Ambassador.” \n \nBilly’s unshakeable belief in the power of God’s word to transform hearts gave hope to all who listened to his simple message: “God loves you.” He carried this message around the world through his crusades, bringing entire generations to faith in Jesus Christ.  \n \nIn the wake of the September 11th attacks in 2001, America turned to Billy Graham at the National Cathedral, who told us, “God can be trusted, even when life seems at its darkest.”\n \nReverend Graham would be the first to say that he did not do it alone. Before her passing, his wife Ruth was by his side through it all—a true partner, a wonderful mother, and a fellow missionary soul. He also built an international team and institution that will continue to carry on Christ’s message. \n \nMelania and I were privileged to get to know Reverend Graham and his extraordinary family over the last several years, and we are deeply grateful for their love and support. \n \nBilly Graham was truly one of a kind.

Vivian was one of Dr. King’s closest advisors. “Martin taught us,” he says, “that it’s in the action that we find out who we really are.” And time and again, Reverend Vivian was among the first to be in the action. In 1947, he joined a sit-in to integrate an Illinois restaurant. He was one of the first Freedom Riders. In Selma, he stood on the courthouse steps to register blacks to vote -- and was beaten, bloodied and jailed for it. In standing up, he helped inspire a young woman to sit down and hold her ground. Her name was Rosa Parks. She said of him, “Even after things had supposedly been taken care of and we had our rights, he was still out there, inspiring the next generation, including me.”\n \nAnd me.

She was engaged to her partner, Thea, for forty years.  After a wedding in Canada, they were married for less than two.  But federal law didn’t recognize a marriage like theirs as valid – which meant that they were denied certain federal rights and benefits that other married couples enjoyed.  And when Thea passed away, Edie spoke up – not for special treatment, but for equal treatment – so that other legally married same-sex couples could enjoy the same federal rights and benefits as anyone else.\n \nIn my second inaugural address, I said that if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.  And because people like Edie stood up, my administration stopped defending the so-called Defense of Marriage Act in the courts.  The day that the Supreme Court issued its 2013 ruling in United States v. Windsor was a great day for Edie, and a great day for America – a victory for human decency, equality, freedom, and justice.  And I called Edie that day to congratulate her.\n \nTwo years later, to the day, we took another step forward on our journey as the Supreme Court recognized a Constitutional guarantee of marriage equality.  It was a victory for families, and for the principle that all of us should be treated equally, regardless of who we are or who we love.\n \nI thought about Edie that day.  I thought about all the millions of quiet heroes across the decades whose countless small acts of courage slowly made an entire country realize that love is love – and who, in the process, made us all more free.  They deserve our gratitude.  And so does Edie.\n \nMichelle and I offer our condolences to her wife, Judith, and to all who loved and looked up to Edie Windsor.', 'Americans always answer the call. OneAmericaAppeal.org', 'Immigration can be a controversial topic. We all want safe, secure borders and a dynamic economy, and people of goodwill can have legitimate disagreements about how to fix our immigration system so that everybody plays by the rules.\n\nBut that’s not what the action that the White House took today is about. This is about young people who grew up in America – kids who study in our schools, young adults who are starting careers, patriots who pledge allegiance to our flag. These Dreamers are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper. They were brought to this country by their parents, sometimes even as infants. They may not know a country besides ours. They may not even know a language besides English. They often have no idea they’re undocumented until they apply for a job, or college, or a driver’s license.\n\nOver the years, politicians of both parties have worked together to write legislation that would have told these young people – our young people – that if your parents brought you here as a child, if you’ve been here a certain number of years, and if you’re willing to go to college or serve in our military, then you’ll get a chance to stay and earn your citizenship. And for years while I was President, I asked Congress to send me such a bill.\n\nThat bill never came. And because it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country. We did so based on the well-established legal principle of prosecutorial discretion, deployed by Democratic and Republican presidents alike, because our immigration enforcement agencies have limited resources, and it makes sense to focus those resources on those who come illegally to this country to do us harm. Deportations of criminals went up. Some 800,000 young people stepped forward, met rigorous requirements, and went through background checks. And America grew stronger as a result.\n\nBut today, that shadow has been cast over some of our best and brightest young people once again. To target these young people is wrong – because they have done nothing wrong. It is self-defeating – because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel. What if our kid’s science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her? To a country she doesn’t know or remember, with a language she may not even speak?\n\nLet’s be clear: the action taken today isn’t required legally. It’s a political decision, and a moral question. Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldn’t threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us. They are that pitcher on our kid’s softball team, that first responder who helps out his community after a disaster, that cadet in ROTC who wants nothing more than to wear the uniform of the country that gave him a chance. Kicking them out won’t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone’s taxes, or raise anybody’s wages.\n\nIt is precisely because this action is contrary to our spirit, and to common sense, that business leaders, faith leaders, economists, and Americans of all political stripes called on the administration not to do what it did today. And now that the White House has shifted its responsibility for these young people to Congress, it’s up to Members of Congress to protect these young people and our future. I’m heartened by those who’ve suggested that they should. And I join my voice with the majority of Americans who hope they step up and do it with a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel.\n\nUltimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we’d want our own kids to be treated. It’s about who we are as a people – and who we want to be.\n\nWhat makes us American is not a question of what we look like, or where our names come from, or the way we pray. What makes us American is our fidelity to a set of ideals – that all of us are created equal; that all of us deserve the chance to make of our lives what we will; that all of us share an obligation to stand up, speak out, and secure our most cherished values for the next generation. That’s how America has traveled this far. That’s how, if we keep at it, we will ultimately reach that more perfect union.', 'More ways to help Houston:', 'Our politics are divided.  They have been for a long time.  And while I know that division makes it difficult to listen to Americans with whom we disagree, that’s what we need to do today.\n \nI recognize that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party.  Still, I hope that our Senators, many of whom I know well, step back and measure what’s really at stake, and consider that the rationale for action, on health care or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did. \n \nWe didn’t fight for the Affordable Care Act for more than a year in the public square for any personal or political gain – we fought for it because we knew it would save lives, prevent financial misery, and ultimately set this country we love on a better, healthier course. \n \nNor did we fight for it alone.  Thousands upon thousands of Americans, including Republicans, threw themselves into that collective effort, not for political reasons, but for intensely personal ones – a sick child, a parent lost to cancer, the memory of medical bills that threatened to derail their dreams.\n \nAnd you made a difference.  For the first time, more than ninety percent of Americans know the security of health insurance.  Health care costs, while still rising, have been rising at the slowest pace in fifty years.  Women can’t be charged more for their insurance, young adults can stay on their parents’ plan until they turn 26, contraceptive care and preventive care are now free.  Paying more, or being denied insurance altogether due to a preexisting condition – we made that a thing of the past. \n \nWe did these things together.  So many of you made that change possible.\n \nAt the same time, I was careful to say again and again that while the Affordable Care Act represented a significant step forward for America, it was not perfect, nor could it be the end of our efforts – and that if Republicans could put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we made to our health care system, that covers as many people at less cost, I would gladly and publicly support it. \n \nThat remains true.  So I still hope that there are enough Republicans in Congress who remember that public service is not about sport or notching a political win, that there’s a reason we all chose to serve in the first place, and that hopefully, it’s to make people’s lives better, not worse. \n \nBut right now, after eight years, the legislation rushed through the House and the Senate without public hearings or debate would do the opposite.  It would raise costs, reduce coverage, roll back protections, and ruin Medicaid as we know it.  That’s not my opinion, but rather the conclusion of all objective analyses, from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which found that 23 million Americans would lose insurance, to America’s doctors, nurses, and hospitals on the front lines of our health care system.\n \nThe Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill.  It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.  It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else.  Those with private insurance will experience higher premiums and higher deductibles, with lower tax credits to help working families cover the costs, even as their plans might no longer cover pregnancy, mental health care, or expensive prescriptions.  Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions could become the norm again.  Millions of families will lose coverage entirely. \n \nSimply put, if there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm.  And small tweaks over the course of the next couple weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation.\n \nI hope our Senators ask themselves – what will happen to the Americans grappling with opioid addiction who suddenly lose their coverage?  What will happen to pregnant mothers, children with disabilities, poor adults and seniors who need long-term care once they can no longer count on Medicaid?  What will happen if you have a medical emergency when insurance companies are once again allowed to exclude the benefits you need, send you unlimited bills, or set unaffordable deductibles?  What impossible choices will working parents be forced to make if their child’s cancer treatment costs them more than their life savings?\n \nTo put the American people through that pain – while giving billionaires and corporations a massive tax cut in return – that’s tough to fathom.  But it’s what’s at stake right now.  So it remains my fervent hope that we step back and try to deliver on what the American people need. \n \nThat might take some time and compromise between Democrats and Republicans.  But I believe that’s what people want to see.  I believe it would demonstrate the kind of leadership that appeals to Americans across party lines.  And I believe that it’s possible – if you are willing to make a difference again.  If you’re willing to call your members of Congress.  If you are willing to visit their offices.  If you are willing to speak out, let them and the country know, in very real terms, what this means for you and your family.\n \nAfter all, this debate has always been about something bigger than politics.  It’s about the character of our country – who we are, and who we aspire to be.  And that’s always worth fighting for.', "Tonight at 9 p.m. Eastern Time, President Obama delivers his farewell address in Chicago.\n\nDon't miss it.", '"Our goal wasn\'t just to make sure more people have coverage—it was to make sure more people have better coverage." —President Obama', 'A majority of Americans say they are ready for immigration reform: http://ofa.bo/p9HH', "Under Obamacare, 16 million people gained health insurance and it's not the “job killer” opponents said it would be. http://ofa.bo/c4z5", '"Climate change once seemed like a problem for future generations, but for most Americans, it\'s already a reality." —President Obama\n\nSee why the President is heading to Alaska. http://ofa.bo/a53M', "The uninsured rate is down to single digits for the first time ever.

We gave him a bone marrow transplant, and suddenly his immune system came online. And we took him for a walk in the garden. This boy who had spent his entire life in a windowless room.

Then a few years ago, I was at my cousin’s wedding in the Bahamas, and some of my cousins got drunk and told me that my father was a huge coke dealer.  Then my sister started laughing, and said: ‘You never figured it out?’  Turns out that I was the only one in the family who didn’t know.  I didn’t handle it very well.

You go to audition after audition, and there are one thousand more ‘no’s’ than ‘yes’s.’  And you try to find that one little thing that you can change that will make all the difference.  ‘Maybe if I lose 5 more lbs.’ Or ‘Maybe if I had gone to that school.’  Or ‘Maybe if I had worked on the lines for 30 more minutes.’  And it’s hard to step back and realize that it’s not even personal.  It wasn’t about your talent.  It’s not that you’re bad or you’re good.  Most likely, the casting director already had a person in their head they were looking for—and you weren’t it.  Or even worse, the role had already been filled, and they were just holding auditions to follow protocol.  Even when you get chosen for a role, success is so fickle and fleeting.  A gig today doesn’t mean a gig tomorrow.  Unless you’re Brad Pitt or Will Smith, and you can make your own demands, you’re always going to be waiting for the approval of someone else.  In order to stay sane, you’ve got to find other things or people in your life that bring you value.  You can’t just be that weird actor person.”', '“I had this feeling in acting school-- that once we got out of the contained environment of school, and into the real world, everything would work itself out.  I thought that the people with talent would naturally rise to the top.  But you learn that the entertainment industry is also a very contained environment.  You learn how little talent actually matters.  So much relies on things that are outside of your control: what you look like, who you know, what agency represents you.  And I knew that race would matter, but I didn’t realize how much.  I just thought my school wasn’t doing plays that catered to ethnicities because we didn’t have many people of color.  I thought in the real world, I’d have more roles to choose from.

He decided at an early age that I was going to run, and he signed me up for races.  My first race was a pee wee race when I was two years old.  The crowd made me so nervous that I laid down in the middle of the race and started crying.  At the age of three, he took me to an ice skating rink, hung my crutches on the wall, and pushed me around on a skate.  When I got older, we ran a 5k together every year on Father’s Day.  Because of my disabilities, it made other members of my family nervous that my father pushed me so hard.  But he taught me persistence and he taught me survival.”', 'Big news.
