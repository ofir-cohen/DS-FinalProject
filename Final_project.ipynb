      "C.T. Vivian is one of those heroes. A Baptist minister, C.T. Vivian was one of Dr. King’s closest advisors. “Martin taught us,” he says, “that it’s in the action that we find out who we really are.” And time and again, Reverend Vivian was among the first to be in the action. In 1947, he joined a sit-in to integrate an Illinois restaurant. He was one of the first Freedom Riders. In Selma, he stood on the courthouse steps to register blacks to vote -- and was beaten, bloodied and jailed for it. In standing up, he helped inspire a young woman to sit down and hold her ground. Her name was Rosa Parks. She said of him, “Even after things had supposedly been taken care of and we had our rights, he was still out there, inspiring the next generation, including me.”\n",

      "“I feel like God has given me a talent for art, and using that talent is a form of gratitude.  For years I worked in an automotive workshop.  I’d try to paint when I came home, but I never had any energy left.  So I finally quit.  Now I have more freedom to develop my talents, but it hasn’t been easy.  Art is more difficult in this country.  It’s not really seen as a profession.  It would be easier if I was alone, but I have a family to support so there’s a lot of pressure to earn.  I’m trying to be tough in poverty.  I read a lot of poetry to give me strength.  I would never beg, so right now I’m drawing portraits and caricatures to support myself.  I’d rather be painting what I think and feel, but I have to fulfill what the consumer wants.”\n",

He gambled away our possessions.  We couldn’t buy anything for ourselves because he would sell it.  He sold all our electronics.  He even sold our furniture.  But my mother still did everything for him: cooked his food, did his laundry… everything.  Then one day she came home from work and the house was empty.  There was nothing left but our clothes.  I told her it was time to go.  For the last two years we’ve been living in a rented house together.  Mom seems so much lighter now.  We can own our own things.  We can actually make progress and move forward in life.  I've started working at a pharmacy and I'm paying my way through college.  I’m still in touch with my father.  I even give him money for rent and food.  I have no interest in taking revenge.  I’m showing him how he should have treated us.”      \n",

So I’m trying to pay my clients back the initial amount they invested.  I sold my other business.  I sold two houses and a car.  That’s why I’m taking trains and online taxis.  Some of my clients feel sorry for me.  Most of them are angry.  A few hate me.  All of them keep calling.  I tell them to give me time, but they keep calling.  I’m smoking four packs of cigarettes a day because of the stress.  I’ve got to find fresh money.  If I can get new clients, then I can slowly repay the old ones with the profits that I make.

My mother was backed into a corner.  She had four young children but no income.  At the time she was a very feminine housewife.  But she asked our neighbors to teach her how to farm.  Then she convinced our landlord to let her plant an empty field.  He told her, ‘If you can make it yield anything, we’ll split the profits.’  It didn’t succeed right away.  There were a lot of pests.  Some of the crops dried out.  But my mother harvested whatever was left, and it was enough to support our family.  She cut off her hair during this time.  She got very muscular.  She worked all day in the fields but still found time to make sure we went to school.  If my brothers and I ever started crying, she’d tell us: ‘If I’m strong enough to do this, you’re strong enough to go to school.’”    \n",

Then finally I came home early one day and found them in my house.  I was heartbroken.  Because I really did love her.  I left town immediately after the divorce because I didn’t want to be reminded of the heartbreak.  I’ve lived in Jakarta for three years now.  I have my own shop.  I’ve saved a lot of money.  I’m doing better than I ever have before.  My plan was to become successful and win my wife back, but my daughter tells me that she’s already remarried.  So I’m hoping to meet someone else.

right SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   NEWLINE   NEWLINE Few were as small in stature as Edie Windsor – and few made as big a difference to America SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE   NEWLINE I had the privilege to speak with Edie a few days ago, and to tell her one more time what a difference she made to this country we love SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   She was engaged to her partner, Thea, for forty years SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   After a wedding in Canada, they were married for less than two SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   But federal law didn’t recognize a marriage like theirs as valid – which meant that they were denied certain federal rights and benefits that other married couples enjoyed SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   And when Thea passed away, Edie spoke up – not for special treatment, but for equal treatment – so that other legally married same-sex couples could enjoy the same federal rights and benefits as anyone else SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE   NEWLINE In my second inaugural address, I said that if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   And because people like Edie stood up, my administration stopped defending the so-called Defense of Marriage Act in the courts SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   The day that the Supreme Court issued its 2013 ruling in United States v SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  Windsor was a great day for Edie, and a great day for America – a victory for human decency, equality, freedom, and justice SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   And I called Edie that day to congratulate her SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE   NEWLINE Two years later, to the day, we took another step forward on our journey as the Supreme Court recognized a Constitutional guarantee of marriage equality SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   It was a victory for families, and for the principle that all of us should be treated equally, regardless of who we are or who we love SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE   NEWLINE I thought about Edie that day SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   I thought about all the millions of quiet heroes across the decades whose countless small acts of courage slowly made an entire country realize that love is love – and who, in the process, made us all more free SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   They deserve our gratitude SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   And so does Edie SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE   NEWLINE Michelle and I offer our condolences to her wife, Judith, and to all who loved and looked up to Edie Windsor SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEXTPOST SENTENCESTART Americans always answer the call SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  OneAmericaAppeal SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART org NEXTPOST SENTENCESTART Immigration can be a controversial topic SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  We all want safe, secure borders and a dynamic economy, and people of goodwill can have legitimate disagreements about how to fix our immigration system so that everybody plays by the rules SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE  NEWLINE But that’s not what the action that the White House took today is about SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  This is about young people who grew up in America – kids who study in our schools, young adults who are starting careers, patriots who pledge allegiance to our flag SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  These Dreamers are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  They were brought to this country by their parents, sometimes even as infants SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  They may not know a country besides ours SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  They may not even know a language besides English SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  They often have no idea they’re undocumented until they apply for a job, or college, or a driver’s license SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE  NEWLINE Over the years, politicians of both parties have worked together to write legislation that would have told these young people – our young people – that if your parents brought you here as a child, if you’ve been here a certain number of years, and if you’re willing to go to college or serve in our military, then you’ll get a chance to stay and earn your citizenship SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  And for years while I was President, I asked Congress to send me such a bill SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE  NEWLINE That bill never came SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  And because it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  We did so based on the well-established legal principle of prosecutorial discretion, deployed by Democratic and Republican presidents alike, because our immigration enforcement agencies have limited resources, and it makes sense to focus those resources on those who come illegally to this country to do us harm SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  Deportations of criminals went up SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  Some 800,000 young people stepped forward, met rigorous requirements, and went through background checks SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  And America grew stronger as a result SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE  NEWLINE But today, that shadow has been cast over some of our best and brightest young people once again SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  To target these young people is wrong – because they have done nothing wrong SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  It is self-defeating – because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  And it is cruel SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  What if our kid’s science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her? To a country she doesn’t know or remember, with a language she may not even speak? NEWLINE  NEWLINE Let’s be clear: the action taken today isn’t required legally SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  It’s a political decision, and a moral question SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldn’t threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  They are that pitcher on our kid’s softball team, that first responder who helps out his community after a disaster, that cadet in ROTC who wants nothing more than to wear the uniform of the country that gave him a chance SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  Kicking them out won’t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone’s taxes, or raise anybody’s wages SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE  NEWLINE It is precisely because this action is contrary to our spirit, and to common sense, that business leaders, faith leaders, economists, and Americans of all political stripes called on the administration not to do what it did today SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  And now that the White House has shifted its responsibility for these young people to Congress, it’s up to Members of Congress to protect these young people and our future SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  I’m heartened by those who’ve suggested that they should SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  And I join my voice with the majority of Americans who hope they step up and do it with a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE  NEWLINE Ultimately, this is about basic decency SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we’d want our own kids to be treated SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  It’s about who we are as a people – and who we want to be SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE  NEWLINE What makes us American is not a question of what we look like, or where our names come from, or the way we pray SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  What makes us American is our fidelity to a set of ideals – that all of us are created equal; that all of us deserve the chance to make of our lives what we will; that all of us share an obligation to stand up, speak out, and secure our most cherished values for the next generation SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  That’s how America has traveled this far SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  That’s how, if we keep at it, we will ultimately reach that more perfect union SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEXTPOST SENTENCESTART More ways to help Houston: NEXTPOST SENTENCESTART Our politics are divided SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   They have been for a long time SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   And while I know that division makes it difficult to listen to Americans with whom we disagree, that’s what we need to do today SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE   NEWLINE I recognize that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   Still, I hope that our Senators, many of whom I know well, step back and measure what’s really at stake, and consider that the rationale for action, on health care or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   NEWLINE   NEWLINE We didn’t fight for the Affordable Care Act for more than a year in the public square for any personal or political gain – we fought for it because we knew it would save lives, prevent financial misery, and ultimately set this country we love on a better, healthier course SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   NEWLINE   NEWLINE Nor did we fight for it alone SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   Thousands upon thousands of Americans, including Republicans, threw themselves into that collective effort, not for political reasons, but for intensely personal ones – a sick child, a parent lost to cancer, the memory of medical bills that threatened to derail their dreams SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE   NEWLINE And you made a difference SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   For the first time, more than ninety percent of Americans know the security of health insurance SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   Health care costs, while still rising, have been rising at the slowest pace in fifty years SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   Women can’t be charged more for their insurance, young adults can stay on their parents’ plan until they turn 26, contraceptive care and preventive care are now free SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   Paying more, or being denied insurance altogether due to a preexisting condition – we made that a thing of the past SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   NEWLINE   NEWLINE We did these things together SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   So many of you made that change possible SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE   NEWLINE At the same time, I was careful to say again and again that while the Affordable Care Act represented a significant step forward for America, it was not perfect, nor could it be the end of our efforts – and that if Republicans could put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we made to our health care system, that covers as many people at less cost, I would gladly and publicly support it SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   NEWLINE   NEWLINE That remains true SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   So I still hope that there are enough Republicans in Congress who remember that public service is not about sport or notching a political win, that there’s a reason we all chose to serve in the first place, and that hopefully, it’s to make people’s lives better, not worse SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   NEWLINE   NEWLINE But right now, after eight years, the legislation rushed through the House and the Senate without public hearings or debate would do the opposite SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   It would raise costs, reduce coverage, roll back protections, and ruin Medicaid as we know it SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   That’s not my opinion, but rather the conclusion of all objective analyses, from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which found that 23 million Americans would lose insurance, to America’s doctors, nurses, and hospitals on the front lines of our health care system SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE   NEWLINE The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   Those with private insurance will experience higher premiums and higher deductibles, with lower tax credits to help working families cover the costs, even as their plans might no longer cover pregnancy, mental health care, or expensive prescriptions SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions could become the norm again SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   Millions of families will lose coverage entirely SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   NEWLINE   NEWLINE Simply put, if there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   And small tweaks over the course of the next couple weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE   NEWLINE I hope our Senators ask themselves – what will happen to the Americans grappling with opioid addiction who suddenly lose their coverage?  What will happen to pregnant mothers, children with disabilities, poor adults and seniors who need long-term care once they can no longer count on Medicaid?  What will happen if you have a medical emergency when insurance companies are once again allowed to exclude the benefits you need, send you unlimited bills, or set unaffordable deductibles?  What impossible choices will working parents be forced to make if their child’s cancer treatment costs them more than their life savings? NEWLINE   NEWLINE To put the American people through that pain – while giving billionaires and corporations a massive tax cut in return – that’s tough to fathom SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   But it’s what’s at stake right now SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   So it remains my fervent hope that we step back and try to deliver on what the American people need SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   NEWLINE   NEWLINE That might take some time and compromise between Democrats and Republicans SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   But I believe that’s what people want to see SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   I believe it would demonstrate the kind of leadership that appeals to Americans across party lines SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   And I believe that it’s possible – if you are willing to make a difference again SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   If you’re willing to call your members of Congress SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   If you are willing to visit their offices SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART   If you are willing to speak out, let them and the country know, in very real terms, what this means for you and your family SENTENCEEND SENTENCESTART  NEWLINE   NEWLINE After all, this debate has always been about something bigger
